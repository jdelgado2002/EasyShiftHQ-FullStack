## Technical Summary

The system is structured around a modular ABP.io-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

* Domain logic in `easyshifthq.Domain`
* Data access via Entity Framework Core in `easyshifthq.EntityFrameworkCore`
* API endpoints through `easyshifthq.HttpApi`
* Web UI in `easyshifthq.Web`
* Database management via `easyshifthq.DbMigrator`

## High-Level Overview

* **Architecture Style:** Modular Monolith
* **Repo Structure:** Multi-project, single repository (Monorepo)
* **Primary Flow:**

  * Employees submit availability and view/edit shifts
  * Managers edit/publish schedules and approve changes
  * System detects issues and alerts managers/leadership

        R -- (Displays Reports) --> U
    end

    U -->|Access Reports| R
```

## Architectural / Design Patterns Adopted

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** All business logic resides in `Domain`
* **Repository Pattern:** For data access abstraction
* **Service Layer:** Application logic in `Application` layer
* **Modular Monolith:** Well-isolated module boundaries
* **RESTful APIs:** Defined via DTOs and Controllers

## Component View

* **Shift Management Module**

  * Handles creation, editing, and assignment of shifts
* **Availability Module**

  * Collects and stores employee availability
* **Validation & Alert Engine**

  * Detects scheduling conflicts and compliance issues
* **Schedule Viewer**

  * Web component to show role/location-based schedule
* **Leadership Dashboard**

  * Aggregated view with compliance and performance insights

```

## API Reference

### Schedule API (Planned)

* `GET /api/v1/schedules`: List of shifts
* `POST /api/v1/schedules`: Create/update shifts
* `POST /api/v1/shift-trades`: Initiate trade
* `POST /api/v1/availability`: Submit availability

## Data Models

Key Entities:

* `Employee`
* `Shift`
* `Availability`
* `ShiftTrade`
* `ScheduleAlert`

## Core Workflow / Sequence Diagrams

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant E as Employee
  participant M as Manager
  participant S as System

  E->>S: Submit availability
  M->>S: Create/Edit schedule
  S->>S: Validate schedule
  S->>M: Send alerts (e.g., OT risk)
  E->>M: Request shift trade
  M->>S: Approve/Deny
```
